OntoATMProject is a n3 (https://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/n3/) project which allow us 
verification matching among software components
about an ATM system (Atm, Bank, Card, Printer, UserConsole)
which consists of:
1.-An core ontology for software components "ontocoresc.n3"
2.
3.-Atm.IDL and its corresponding instance file in n3 => Atm.n3
4.
5.-Bank.IDL and its corresponding instance file in n3 => Bank.n3
6.
7.-Card.IDL and its corresponding instance file in n3 => Card.n3
8.
9.-Printer.IDL and its corresponding instance file in n3 => Printer.n3
10.
11.-UserConsole.IDL and its corresponding instance file in n3 => UserConsole.n3 
12.Remarks: For each IDL File it was neccesary transforming in an n3 file using
         Moctezuma prototype.

For testing this semantic project you have to download the file "OntoATMProject.n3"
and the SPARQL query "Query1-SyntacticOperators.sparql"
