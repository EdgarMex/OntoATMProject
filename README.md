OntoATMProject is a n3 project which allow us 
verification matching among software components
about an ATM system (Atm, Bank, Card, Printer, UserConsole)
which consists of:
1.-An core ontology for software components "ontocoresc.n3"
2.
3.-Atm.IDL and its corresponding instance file in n3 => Atm.n3
4.
5.-Bank.IDL and its corresponding instance file in n3 => Bank.n3
6.
7.-Card.IDL and its corresponding instance file in n3 => Card.n3
8.
9.-Printer.IDL and its corresponding instance file in n3 => Printer.n3
10.
11.-UserConsole.IDL and its corresponding instance file in n3 => UserConsole.n3 

A SPARQL query "QueryPrePosInv2.SPARQL" can be used for test the "OntoATMProject" 

Remarks: For each IDL File it was neccesary transforming in an n3 file using
         Moctezuma prototype.
